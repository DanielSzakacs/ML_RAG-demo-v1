# üìÑ Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project

This repository contains a local implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which combines information retrieval techniques with text generation models. The project leverages a dense retrieval system to find relevant information from a local dataset and integrates this with a generative model to answer queries based on the retrieved context.

## üîç Project Overview

The **RAG** approach enhances the capabilities of language models by allowing them to fetch relevant knowledge from external sources before generating responses. This makes the model more accurate, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks, by combining retrieval and generation.

### Key Features:
- **Local Data Retrieval**: Uses a pre-indexed local dataset to retrieve relevant documents based on the input query.
- **Text Embedding**: Converts text data into vector embeddings using a sentence-transformer model for efficient similarity search.
- **Generative Model**: Integrates a pre-trained generative model to generate human-like responses conditioned on the retrieved documents.
- **Similarity Search**: Implements fast cosine similarity or dot product search to find the most relevant documents from the dataset.
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Combines the retrieval and generative steps for efficient and context-aware query resolution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **SentenceTransformers**: For embedding generation.
- **PyTorch**: As the backend for running models.
- **FAISS (or another retrieval method)**: For efficient nearest-neighbor search on vector embeddings.
- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: To integrate the generative model.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Document Indexing**: A local corpus is split into smaller chunks and transformed into embeddings using a sentence transformer model.
2. **Query Encoding**: The user's query is also encoded into an embedding vector.
3. **Retrieval**: The encoded query is compared to the indexed embeddings using similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity), and the most relevant documents are retrieved.
4. **Response Generation**: The generative model (e.g., GPT) uses the retrieved documents as context to generate an informative response.
